# OverPower MT5 ReadMe

## Introduction
OverPower MT5 is an advanced Forex trading software developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. This software is designed to execute trading operations based on specific market conditions and signals. This ReadMe file provides an overview of the code implementation and how the software works.

## Code Description
The code provided implements the OverPower MT5 trading software based on the provided terms of reference. It consists of several functions and variables to define necessary input parameters, initialize the software, execute trading logic, and manage stop conditions. The code structure and functionality are described in detail below.

### Input Parameters
The following input parameters are defined in the code:
- `Symbol1`: Specifies the first currency pair to trade (default: EURUSD).
- `Symbol2`: Specifies the second currency pair to trade (default: GBPUSD).

### Variables
The code defines the following variables:
- `mainLotSize`: Stores the initial lot size based on the account type.
- `isLearningMode`: Determines whether the software is in learning mode or not based on market conditions.

### Initialization Function (OnInit)
The `OnInit` function is called when the EA (Expert Advisor) is first initialized. It sets the initial lot size based on the account type and determines the learning mode based on market conditions.

### Start Function (OnStart)
The `OnStart` function is called when the EA is started or restarted. It contains a while loop that continuously checks if trading is allowed and if the EA is stopped. Within the loop, it first checks if the learning mode is enabled and learns from market trends if it is. Then, it executes the trading logic based on buy and sell signals. Finally, it checks for stop conditions and stops trading if necessary. The loop waits for 1 second before checking again.

### Learning from Market Trends (LearnFromMarketTrends)
The `LearnFromMarketTrends` function is called when the learning mode is enabled. It is where the learning algorithm should be implemented to analyze and learn from market trends.

### Buy and Sell Signal Functions (IsBuySignal, IsSellSignal)
The `IsBuySignal` and `IsSellSignal` functions are responsible for determining whether a buy or sell signal is present, respectively. The buy and sell signal logic should be implemented within these functions.

### Buy and Sell Trade Execution Functions (Buy, Sell)
The `Buy` and `Sell` functions are responsible for executing the buy and sell trades, respectively. The buy and sell trade logic should be implemented within these functions.

### Stop Condition Function (IsStopConditionReached)
The `IsStopConditionReached` function is responsible for checking if a stop condition is reached. The stop condition logic should be implemented within this function.

### Stop Trading Function (StopTrading)
The `StopTrading` function is responsible for stopping the trading operations. The trading stop logic should be implemented within this function.
